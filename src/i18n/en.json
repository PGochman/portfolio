    "ABOUT_TEXT": "I studied architecture in high school and electronic engineering in college. Throughout the three years of my college education, I developed a strong interest in programming, leading me to decide to focus solely on studying that. For my initial educational experience, I attended a programming bootcamp called Soy Henry, where I learned full-stack web development and various technologies associated with it, such as React, Redux, Next, Tailwind, Express, Sequelize, PostgreSQL, etc. Additionally, during the bootcamp, I completed my first two projects, which reinforced my knowledge and allowed me to explore new territories. Collaborating with a team on these projects taught me valuable lessons about working on a project collectively. Currently, I am seeking my first professional experience while planning to continue my education and self-improvement to become a better programmer every day.",
